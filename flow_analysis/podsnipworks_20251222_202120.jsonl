The screen is requesting users to upload a photo of official identification with their date of birth visible.\n\nThis appears to be an identity verification requirement rather than a posting failure. The \"loop recovery failed\" likely occurred because the user got stuck in this verification flow and couldn't proceed with normal app functions. To fix this, the user would need to either complete the ID verification process by uploading the requested documentation, or potentially try logging out and back in to reset the session."}
