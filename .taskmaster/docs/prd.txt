# Geelark Instagram Account Setup Automation

## Goal
Automate Instagram account creation on Geelark cloud phones. One script, simple flow.

## How It Works
1. Take screenshot of Geelark device
2. Send to Claude Vision: "What screen is this? What should I tap/type? Give coordinates."
3. Execute the action (tap, type, scroll)
4. Repeat until account is created and set up

## External Services
- **DaisySMS**: Get phone number, receive SMS codes
- **2Captcha**: Solve captchas when they appear
- **Mobile Proxy**: Hit rotation URL before each new account

## Geelark Control
Research needed: How to programmatically control Geelark devices
- Option A: Their RPA feature
- Option B: ADB connection
- Option C: Their API (if exists)

## Account Setup Steps
Handle whatever Instagram shows (order varies):
- Enter birthday
- Enter phone number (from DaisySMS)
- Enter SMS code (from DaisySMS)
- Create username
- Create password
- Solve captcha if shown (via 2Captcha)
- Skip optional steps
- Add profile photo
- Add bio
- Switch to Creator account
- Follow ~20 accounts

## Inputs
- Profile photos (folder of images)
- Bios (text file, one per line)
- Accounts to follow (text file)
- Proxy rotation URL
- API keys (DaisySMS, 2Captcha, Anthropic)

## Output
- CSV with created accounts: username, password, phone used, status

## Success
- Create one account end-to-end
- Then scale to multiple

## Tech
- Python
- Claude Vision API for screen reading
- Simple loop, no fancy architecture
