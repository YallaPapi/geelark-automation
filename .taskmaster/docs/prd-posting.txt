# Geelark Instagram Posting Automation

## Goal
Automatically post videos to Instagram accounts on Geelark cloud phones. Read videos and captions from a spreadsheet, post to each account.

## The Problem
- Geelark's built-in automation is unreliable and can't add captions
- VAs are slow and make mistakes
- Need to post across many accounts efficiently

## How It Works
1. Load spreadsheet with: account, video file, caption
2. For each row:
   - Open that account's Geelark device
   - Rotate proxy (hit rotation URL)
   - Take screenshot
   - Use Claude Vision to navigate Instagram posting flow
   - Upload video, add caption, post
   - Log result
3. Move to next row

## Posting Flow (what Claude Vision navigates)
1. Open Instagram app
2. Tap "+" button (create post)
3. Select "Reel" or post type
4. Select video from device gallery
5. Tap "Next"
6. Add caption (paste from spreadsheet)
7. Tap "Share"
8. Confirm post was successful
9. Done

## Inputs
- **Spreadsheet (CSV)**: columns = account_name, video_path, caption
- **Videos**: folder with video files (or already on Geelark devices)
- **Proxy rotation URL**: to rotate IP between posts
- **API keys**: Anthropic (Claude Vision), 2Captcha (if needed)

## Geelark Control
Need to figure out:
- How to take screenshots from Geelark
- How to tap/type on Geelark devices
- How to transfer videos to Geelark devices (or are they already there?)
- Options: RPA, ADB, API

## Output
- Log file with: account, video, status (success/fail), timestamp, error if any

## Edge Cases
- Instagram asks for login → handle or skip
- Captcha appears → use 2Captcha
- Post fails → log error, continue to next
- Rate limit → wait and retry

## MVP (Minimum to get working)
1. Control ONE Geelark device
2. Post ONE video with caption
3. Confirm it worked

Then scale to multiple accounts.

## Tech
- Python
- Claude Vision API
- Simple loop
- CSV for input/output
