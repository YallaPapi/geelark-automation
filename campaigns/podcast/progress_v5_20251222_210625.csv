The answer might be sitting in your produce aisle. Beetroot extract delivers measurable improvements in endurance, recovery, and cognitive function by ramping up nitric oxide production—meaning better oxygen delivery to both muscles and brain tissue.

The results speak for themselves: athletes taking beetroot juice sharpened their decision-making speed by roughly 4% at rest, thanks to increased blood flow to regions controlling motor function and focus. @DrAndyGalpin strategically deploys blood-flow enhancers like beetroot and citrulline for his athletes during nighttime training blocks and when scheduling demands multiple daily sessions—times when stimulants would sabotage sleep quality.

Here's the problem: less than half the population eats enough nitrate-rich vegetables to maintain optimal NO levels. Supplementing with beetroot juice or citrulline bridges that nutritional gap while supporting vascular function throughout the entire body.

Episode 101 of the @foundmyfitness podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin breaks down the science behind performance supplements that actually move the needle on training adaptations and recovery protocols.

Data shows fructose can slash alcohol elimination time by nearly 50% and cut intoxication duration by almost 30% in humans. @foundmyfitness clarifies this isn't a hangover cure, but reveals how whole fruit's fiber and micronutrients may help counter some alcohol damage—unlike refined fructose from juices that can trigger fatty liver disease.

The full FoundMyFitness episode ""The Truth About Alcohol: Risks, Benefits, and Everything In-Between"" breaks down the research on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube.

What's covered:

• Hangover remedies that actually work (spoiler: most don't)
• 1-3 daily drinks = doubled breast cancer risk in women & colon cancer risk in men
• 5 drinks weekly for women = equivalent of smoking 10 cigarettes weekly
• Zinc and magnesium: essential for regular drinkers
• How alcohol accelerates brain volume loss

What happens when you mix a kitchen experiment with zero safety nets? You get @allisonellsworth and @drinkpoppi — a $1.95B homemade soda story that went from Shark Tank to PepsiCo's portfolio.

No beverage background. No playbook. Just an oil & gas exec who bet everything on gut health in a can.

@foundr sat down with Allison to break down the messy middle: rebranding while pregnant, a Vegas trade show gamble that paid off, outselling Trump and Kim K in trending searches, and a Super Bowl commercial that almost never aired.

The real lessons? They're not in the success — they're in the pivots, the instinct calls, and the moments where quitting would've been easier.

For founders wondering if bold moves still work, this conversation is proof.
