When couples sleep apart, both partners actually get better rest, which means better mood, better health, and ironically, a better relationship. Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is let your partner sleep in peace.

✔️ Step 3: Assign every single dollar a job until you hit zero—that's zero-based budgeting in action

Your ego whispers that how things look matters more than what you're building. It's a trap that kills more potential than any actual setback ever could.

The answer might be sitting in your produce aisle. Beetroot extract delivers measurable improvements in endurance, recovery, and cognitive function by ramping up nitric oxide production—meaning better oxygen delivery to both muscles and brain tissue.

The results speak for themselves: athletes taking beetroot juice sharpened their decision-making speed by roughly 4% at rest, thanks to increased blood flow to regions controlling motor function and focus. @DrAndyGalpin strategically deploys blood-flow enhancers like beetroot and citrulline for his athletes during nighttime training blocks and when scheduling demands multiple daily sessions—times when stimulants would sabotage sleep quality.

Here's the problem: less than half the population eats enough nitrate-rich vegetables to maintain optimal NO levels. Supplementing with beetroot juice or citrulline bridges that nutritional gap while supporting vascular function throughout the entire body.

Episode 101 of the @foundmyfitness podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin breaks down the science behind performance supplements that actually move the needle on training adaptations and recovery protocols.
