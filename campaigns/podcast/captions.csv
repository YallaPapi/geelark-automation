C--9A0UyMiA-2.mp4,"Two powerful protocols for dream recall and nightmare release, shared by @hubermanlab after learning them from @rickrubin. The fascinating part? Both techniques align with the body's natural paralysis during REM sleep—when our most emotionally intense dreams occur. While solid science exists on dreaming mechanics, these specific methods haven't been formally studied... yet. Through @scicommedia, the company Huberman co-founded, research is currently underway on NSDR, depression treatments, eating disorders, neuro-immune connections, autism, and reproductive health—with plans to eventually include dream studies. The mission: delivering actionable tools for mental health, physical performance, and overall wellbeing to everyone.

C--xFn7PtLE-1.mp4,"Your brain's protective coating depends on how fit you are—and the data is striking. New research reveals that VO2 max directly correlates with myelin integrity, the insulation around neurons that keeps cognitive function sharp. 

The findings from @foundmyfitness show a dramatic divide: people with peak fitness maintained optimal myelination until age 41, while those with low VO2 max saw their myelin levels collapse before turning 22—a nearly two-decade difference.

Middle-aged and older participants showed the strongest connection between cardiovascular fitness and myelin preservation across nearly every brain region tested. Poor fitness? Accelerated myelin breakdown.

Though the study establishes correlation rather than causation, the implications align with extensive research on exercise's neuroprotective effects. High-intensity interval training stands out as particularly effective for boosting VO2 max, though consistency with any activity you genuinely enjoy matters most.

C-3P5RMy13P-2.mp4,"DNA repair enzymes need magnesium to function properly—and the consequences of not getting enough are more serious than most people realize. @foundmyfitness breaks down research showing that low magnesium levels correlate with increased DNA damage in blood cells, which can trigger cancer-causing mutations. The numbers are startling: in a study of 66,000 participants, every 100 mg decrease in daily magnesium consumption raised pancreatic cancer risk by 24%. With more than half of Americans falling short on their magnesium intake, Dr. Patrick emphasizes the importance of incorporating magnesium-rich foods like cooked spinach and almonds into your diet. For those considering supplements, she recommends highly bioavailable forms such as magnesium citrate, malate, and glycinate for optimal absorption.

C-BN4h4ys8j-2.mp4,"When @hubermanlab sat down with @thenineclub, the conversation turned to a fat loss strategy that's transformed the health of people who struggled for years. His approach centers on high-quality proteins from meat, fish, and eggs that naturally increase satiety and make caloric deficit easier to maintain. The key insight: some individuals can't regulate starchy carbohydrate intake once they begin eating them, linked to hypothalamic function he's explored in depth on his podcast. Combined with cardiovascular and resistance training, this method has helped numerous people shed significant fat and sustain those results long-term. While vegans and vegetarians would need modifications and any weight loss ultimately requires caloric deficit, the satiating power of quality proteins makes adherence dramatically more achievable for many.

* Why training at home beats commercial gyms
* How ROBOTICS and AI are reshaping human performance
* The truth about INTERVAL TRAINING nobody tells you
* Dave's $2 MILLION personal biohacking experiment
* GENE THERAPY and the future waiting for you

C2PydIzO-hc-1.mp4,"A terrifying taxi ride with his daughter Bella almost ended in disaster—but what @edmylett discovered in those white-knuckle moments changed everything about how he views control in life.

The cab crash that happened right after they got out? That wasn't just coincidence. It was the universe delivering a brutal wake-up call about what happens when you hand over the steering wheel of your life to someone else.

In this powerful episode, Ed breaks down the real cost of being a passenger in your own existence. He's challenging everyone to audit their thinking, question whose opinions are driving their decisions, and stop letting fear keep them in the backseat.

This isn't about a scary ride—it's about recognizing the patterns where we surrender control without realizing it. The relationships we tolerate. The dreams we postpone. The voice in our head that isn't even ours.

Ed's pulling back the curtain on how to reclaim your power and become the driver of your own destiny.

What you'll discover:
- Why rapid execution creates mental bandwidth (not stress)
- How quick wins compound into unstoppable momentum

@edmyett breaks down why mediocrity drains your life in ways money can't measure. When you're just going through the motions, you're paying a price that affects how you show up everywhere—and how the world sees you.

His solution? Stop settling. Whether you're raising kids, building businesses, or mastering your craft, greatness requires focused thought, intensity, consistency, and a standard you refuse to compromise on.

Wrong environment? Wrong people? That's usually why the fire's gone. Find where your brilliance belongs and protect that standard like your life depends on it—because it does.

Ed sits down with @charlesduhigg to explore why most people talk past each other—and what the best communicators do differently. This isn't about speaking louder or using fancy words. It's about understanding the psychology behind conversations that actually matter.

Charles reveals the frameworks that separate surface-level chatter from deep, meaningful exchanges that build trust and influence. From mastering active listening to knowing when body language says more than words, this episode delivers tactical strategies anyone can use immediately.

The conversation covers mirroring techniques that create instant rapport, the art of asking questions that open people up, how introverts can leverage their natural strengths, and why teaching kids these skills early changes everything. Ed and Charles also tackle the tough stuff—navigating difficult conversations, setting boundaries without burning bridges, and recognizing when timing makes all the difference.

Real connection isn't optional anymore. It's the skill that determines who leads, who influences, and who builds relationships that last.

He challenges the idea that self-improvement is self-centered, flipping the script entirely: your growth directly determines how much you can give to others. When you stop evolving, you stop serving at your highest level.

The questions he poses cut deep: Is your mind renewing? Your spirit? And the big one—are you putting yourself first or dead last?

Most people sacrifice their own development thinking it makes them more generous, but it actually limits their capacity to make a real difference. Shedding old versions of yourself isn't optional if you want to create lasting impact.

The newest, most evolved version of you unlocks the ability to elevate everyone in your circle. That's not theory—that's how transformation works.

What's covered:

• Hangover remedies that actually work (spoiler: most don't)
• 1-3 daily drinks = doubled breast cancer risk in women & colon cancer risk in men
• 5 drinks weekly for women = equivalent of smoking 10 cigarettes weekly
• Zinc and magnesium: essential for regular drinkers

Wine drinkers carry less visceral fat compared to those who primarily consume beer or spirits—the latter being linked to increased belly fat through disrupted lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. Red wine's association with better kidney function biomarkers and lipid profiles gives it a slight edge in the damage control department.

But here's the reality check: choosing wine isn't a health strategy, it's harm reduction. The alcohol-cancer relationship follows a linear dose-response pattern regardless of your beverage choice.

And those antioxidants everyone talks about? A glass of red wine contains 0.03-1mg of resveratrol, while studies showing benefits use 50-500mg. The math doesn't add up for any real therapeutic effect.

Bottom line: less alcohol equals better health outcomes, regardless of what's in your glass.

Dr. Layne Norton (@biolayne) challenged @foundmyfitness to consider this: if seed oils deserve scrutiny for health impacts, saturated fat demands even more attention based on current research strength.

Worth noting – Layne's background as a champion bodybuilder and powerlifter eating high protein means he's far from anti-meat, and his Ph.D. research history suggests biases that would actually favor the opposite position. Yet he follows where the data leads.

The real concern with seed oils? High heat and reheating situations. But framing them as the singular villain in chronic disease ignores scientific nuance and oversimplifies what's actually a multifaceted problem.

Cu7C5lFgfnb-2.mp4,"What if the secret to unlocking wealth isn't what most people think? @edmylett reveals an unconventional truth that changes everything.

The monotony of modern life is quietly stealing our potential. Same conversations, same circles, same routines—it's all creating an invisible ceiling on our growth.

He breaks down the direct connection between variety in our lives and the richness we experience spiritually, emotionally, and financially. It's not just about tolerating differences—it's about actively seeking them out.

Different backgrounds. Different perspectives. Different experiences. This is where real transformation happens.

When we limit ourselves to familiar faces and comfortable patterns, we're actually limiting our capacity for success and fulfillment. But when we intentionally embrace diversity across every dimension—relationships, spirituality, business, education—we tap into a force that elevates everything.

This breakdown shows exactly why sameness is sabotaging your progress and how to inject powerful variety into your life, regardless of your budget.

The comeback you're working toward? It starts with expanding beyond what's comfortable.

CuHi65Rg2Uq-2.mp4,"High achievers are holding their own happiness hostage, and @edmylett is calling them out on it.

He breaks down why so many driven individuals operate under a dangerous myth: that being happy now will somehow dim their ambition. They're literally rationing joy like it's a limited resource, convinced that staying unhappy keeps them hungry.

But here's the framework that changes everything—""Blissful Dissatisfaction."" It's the ability to be genuinely happy in this moment while simultaneously being unsatisfied with where you are. These aren't opposing forces; they're meant to coexist.

The reality? Happiness is your default setting. You weren't born stressed and striving—you learned that. Which means you can unlearn it too.

Stop postponing joy until the next promotion, relationship, or milestone. You're worthy of happiness right now, and it won't cost you your edge.

Heart disease forced him to confront a brutal question from his doctor: did he want to walk his daughter down the aisle? That single moment crystallized his purpose beyond any motivational speech ever could. He shares how linking his health goals to walking his daughter down the aisle made every sacrifice non-negotiable. The pain of change, the difficulty of growth, the hardship of success—none of it mattered anymore because his WHY became bigger than any obstacle. His message challenges everyone to find that level of purpose that makes the price worth paying. When your reasons run deeper than surface-level desires, you don't just push through—you become unstoppable. What's your non-negotiable?

CukAuZMAh7a-1.mp4,"The depth of this conversation caught @edmylett completely off guard.

Troy Aikman—NFL legend, 3-time Super Bowl champion, Hall of Famer, Fox Sports analyst, and Monday Night Football voice—revealed layers most people never get to witness.

This wasn't just another athlete interview. Ed found himself thinking about their exchange for days, replaying the vulnerability and wisdom Troy brought to every answer.

Beyond the football accolades and broadcasting success, Troy opens up about his relentless commitment to growth—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The hunger never stops, even at the highest levels.

The conversation dives into powerful territory:

- Daily routines and meditation practices
- What makes coaches truly great and what players need from mentors
- Turning criticism and adversity into fuel
- Maintaining hunger after winning championships
- Cold plunges, red light therapy, breath work
- Building a meaningful home life and family experiences

Plus, Troy shares a jaw-dropping story from his broadcasting career involving a life-or-death moment on the field.

This episode will shift how you think about leadership, excellence, and what it takes to sustain greatness.

CupSHxkAgYA-1.mp4,"Your brain operates like a search engine—whatever question you type in, it'll find an answer for. @edmylett breaks down why the quality of your questions literally determines the quality of your life.

Most people trap themselves by asking ""What went wrong?"" and wonder why they stay stuck. The secret? Your thoughts are just questions and answers on repeat. Upgrade the questions, and you'll upgrade everything.

Instead of ""What went wrong?""—try ""What can I learn from this?""

That simple shift tells your brain to search for solutions instead of problems. Right questions = brain in overdrive mode. Wrong questions = dead-end results.

The transformation starts with better questions.

Cv9_d5Qgr8Y-2.mp4,"Championship DNA runs deep in the Hurley family, and @edmylett sat down with the man who proved bloodlines meet breakthrough work ethic.

Dan Hurley didn't just inherit basketball greatness from Naismith Hall of Famer Bob Hurley Sr. or watch his brother Bobby dominate at Duke and the NBA from the sidelines. The University of Connecticut head coach spent over 20 years grinding through Wagner and Rhode Island before cutting down the nets as the 2023 NCAA Champion.

Ed dives into the blueprint Dan used to build three programs from scratch, extracting principles that translate directly to winning your own championships in business, relationships, and life.

The conversation delivers tactical insights on culture definition, pressure communication, trust-based relationships, and why winning isn't actually the ultimate emotion. Dan opens up about how faith, meditation, his morning routine, marriage, and family fuel his ability to compete above the rim.

This is a rare behind-the-scenes look at the pressure, grit, and mindset required to operate at peak performance—with a roadmap you can apply immediately.

@edmylett sits down with MO GAWDAT, ex-Chief Business Officer of GOOGLE X, for a conversation that cuts through the noise and reveals what insiders actually know about artificial intelligence.

Mo helped build the tech that's reshaping civilization. Now he's a three-time bestselling author and hosts the #1 mental health podcast SLO MO—and he's pulling back the curtain on what most people are getting wrong.

This conversation tackles the real questions:
- What those working closest to AI development are actually worried about
- The immediate threats versus long-term consequences
- AI-generated relationships between humans and machines
- Which jobs and careers are most vulnerable
- Whether machines can learn ethics or experience emotions
- Why this is humanity's new OPPENHEIMER MOMENT
- Practical steps for using AI to benefit humanity instead of harming it

No hype. No conspiracy theories. Just raw truth from someone who's been inside the room where AI decisions are made.

Ed captures insights that will shift how you think about technology's trajectory and your place in what's coming next.

When goals fall short and the voice in your head questions everything, those INTENTIONS become the anchor. They're proof that you're trying to serve, help, and genuinely make an impact.

Not every attempt will succeed, but being a person who shows up with pure INTENTIONS—that's worth celebrating on the hardest days.

He challenges us to flip the script: celebrate others' wins without letting comparison poison your own progress. Use their success as inspiration, not a measuring stick. Because the moment you start living through someone else's lens, you've already lost a game that was rigged from the start.

The life you're meant to live isn't hiding in someone else's story. It's waiting in the unique joy only YOUR journey can deliver.

Here's what Ed Mylett knows that most people miss: storytelling isn't just a ""nice-to-have"" skill—it's the foundation of real influence and wealth creation.

Whether you're a parent trying to guide your children, a business person closing deals, a pastor leading your congregation, a coach rallying your team, an artist building a fanbase, or a teacher inspiring students—the ability to craft compelling narratives is non-negotiable.

Statistics and data have their place, but they can't unlock the emotional doors that specific, personal stories can.

Look at Apple's playbook. They could lead with specs—processor speed, storage capacity, technical features. Instead, they show real people living their best lives, telling authentic stories through their devices. That's not accidental. It's strategic mastery of persuasion through narrative.

Ed breaks down why facts inform but stories transform. When you learn to move people emotionally, you create action. And that's influence in its purest form.

Study how the best brands do it. Then apply it to your world, no matter the scale.

The breakthrough? When you help others, you help yourself. That's where real transformation begins.

Ed explains how everyone you meet—literally every single person—was born with a dream. They're all searching for a leader to help them achieve it. And yes, that leader can be YOU.

Parent? You're a leader. Friend? Leader. Employee with no direct reports? You still lead yourself daily. Leadership isn't a title, it's a responsibility we all carry.

Three non-negotiables that separate the financially free from the perpetually broke:

1. Practice DISCIPLINE
2. SAVE no matter your income
3. Live BELOW YOUR MEANS

Skip these? Expect stress, depression, and anger to be your constant companions.

The real cost isn't just money—it's the better life you're cheating yourself out of by refusing to get right with your finances.

Mental resilience operates like muscle hypertrophy: adaptation requires progressive overload. Choosing difficulty voluntarily, not reactively, triggers distinct neurological development that compounds over time.

What separates those who endure from those who transcend? The latter doesn't wait for hardship to arrive—they pursue it systematically, building what some call a ""mental callus"" through deliberate exposure.

The distinction matters: forced discomfort versus chosen discomfort creates different neural pathways. One is survival. The other is evolution.

Researchers have identified specific brain regions linked to sustained will—proof that resilience isn't inherited personality, but constructed through repeated decision-making patterns.

Every choice reinforces a trajectory. Every action sets a precedent.

DAmRHMmyBFh-2.mp4,"Microplastics are everywhere, but the body's detox systems might get a major upgrade from an unexpected source. @foundmyfitness breaks down how sulforaphane—concentrated 100X more in broccoli sprouts than mature broccoli—activates the NRF2 pathway, essentially turning up the dial on phase II detoxification enzymes. These enzymes latch onto chemicals like BPA, BPS, and phthalates, making them water-soluble so they can be flushed out. Animal research shows rodents given sulforaphane alongside BPA exposure had ramped-up detox enzymes and reduced toxicity. While direct human evidence is still limited, the mechanism is sound—sulforaphane has already been shown to boost excretion of air pollutants like benzene and acrolein by up to 60%. Incorporating broccoli sprouts or quality sulforaphane supplements could strengthen the body's natural ability to process and eliminate endocrine disruptors tied to microplastics. Episode 95 of the FoundMyFitness Podcast covers microplastics in depth, and episode 52 dives into sulforaphane science. Full details available at foundmyfitness.com

Start your morning tech-free (at least an hour before screens). Brew tea, grab pen and paper, then list 3-5 things causing you the most anxiety—usually the tasks you've been avoiding for days.

The filter questions change everything: ""If this were my only accomplishment today, would I be satisfied?"" and ""Does this make everything else irrelevant?""

Whatever passes that test gets a dedicated 2-3 hour block. Not scattered minutes throughout the day—one uninterrupted session. Everything else waits.

His reminder: when distraction hits, skip the guilt spiral and simply return to your ONE priority.

The numbers tell a powerful story: children with restricted sugar exposure in utero and through age 2 showed 35% less diabetes, 20% less hypertension, and 30% less obesity as adults. They also developed diabetes and high blood pressure 2-4 years later than their counterparts.

The protective effects scaled with duration:
• In utero alone: 8-15% risk reduction
• Through first year: 15-25% reduction
• Through age 2: 19-36% reduction

Despite current guidelines recommending zero added sugar for children under 2, most consume three times the recommended amount for older children. Dr. Patrick spent months researching these developmental factors during her own pregnancy and continues investigating how maternal and early childhood nutrition influences lifelong health outcomes.

She's releasing a detailed email breakdown Wednesday covering this study (PMID: 39480913) and its implications for protecting children's future health through early dietary choices.

Sled pushes and pulls hammer the legs, glutes, and core while doubling as serious cardio and metabolic conditioning. Box jumps? They're her secret weapon for explosive power and fast-twitch muscle fiber development—key for maintaining agility and physical capability with age. Her advice: stop searching for miracle solutions and start consistently challenging yourself through movement. That's where the magic happens.

DBb_zDzSebb-2.mp4,"A five-day experiment with canned soup revealed urinary BPA levels skyrocketing to 20.8 µg/L—among the highest recorded outside factory workers, according to @foundmyfitness. The same plastic lining found in soup cans exists in most aluminum beverage and food containers, from sodas to sparkling water. Research shows drinking from BPA-lined cans can spike blood pressure 16-fold versus glass bottles, with urinary concentrations at these levels correlating to hormonal disruptions. The solution isn't complicated: swapping canned products for alternatives in glass, cartons, or fresh options significantly cuts BPA exposure and its associated long-term health risks.

The difference between those who break through and those who stay stuck? One group questions their limiting stories. The other accepts them as truth.

Skills can be developed. Solutions can be discovered. Setbacks become stepping stones. It all starts with recognizing which ""monsters"" are real and which ones we've conjured up ourselves 🎃

The power to move forward has always been there—it just requires calling out the false evidence for what it really is 💪

According to his conversation with @hubermanlab, that initial gaze triggers an entire sequence of right brain synchronization that lets us genuinely access another person's emotional state. The episode dives into how these neural pathways form between infants and caregivers, shape our adult relationships, and determine whether we seek external support or process internally when stressed. They also tackle a fascinating question: is our texting habit rewiring us to be more left-brain dominant and losing our ability to emotionally attune face-to-face?

DCmiiOTS4Cp-2.mp4,"The math is surprisingly simple: 7 grams of protein plus 2 grams of fiber per 100 calories could be your weight loss solution.

New research reveals that participants who ate foods meeting this protein-to-fiber ratio dropped up to 13% of their body weight in 12 months—no calorie counting, no constant weigh-ins, no food diary required. Even better? Nearly 80% of what they lost was fat mass, with only 15% coming from muscle.

The science backs it up: fiber keeps you satisfied longer while protein does double duty—crushing hunger AND burning more calories through its thermic effect. Together, they protect your lean mass while targeting fat loss.

Whether you're trying to shed pounds, maintain your current weight, or just stay full between meals, this whole-food approach delivers results plus bonus benefits for your muscles, bones, and gut health.

During races, these athletes face forces up to 6 Gs through corners and braking zones—turning their 6-7 kg head and helmet combo into a crushing 36-42 kg weight. The average human neck? Built for a measly 1-2 Gs.

Their solution involves brutal training protocols: weighted helmets carrying an extra 10-15 kg, resistance bands, and dedicated neck machines. The commitment runs deep—1-2 hours every single day during off-season just for neck conditioning.

This specialized training allows them to maintain performance throughout entire 90-minute races. For comparison, most people couldn't even sit in the cockpit under race conditions without their neck giving out.

Two separate procedures in Turkey at the Live Life Taller clinic—one breaking and extending his tibia and fibula in December 2022, another lengthening his femurs in March 2023—brought him to nearly 6'7"". Total investment: $106,000.

The catch? Your body's insulin sensitivity naturally drops in evening hours, creating a tension between time-restricted eating advocates and those prioritizing muscle protein synthesis on training days. For lifters, a strategic low-calorie protein shake before bed becomes a practical tool to hit daily protein targets while supporting recovery during what would otherwise be an extended fasting period. Non-training days require different considerations given how exercise influences insulin response. More insights available on the Science of Protein podcast across all platforms.

DDwhp8XOTpt-2.mp4,"Even drone signals fall under Wiretap Act protection, creating a surprising legal barrier for law enforcement attempting to track mysterious aerial activity.

The Wiretap Act requires authorities to secure a warrant before intercepting communications between drones and their operators—yes, even for unmanned aircraft. Judges must see probable cause that surveillance will reveal evidence of a specific crime before approving any monitoring request.

Emergency exceptions do exist for immediate national security threats, but they come with a catch: retroactive judicial approval must happen within 48 hours. Recent drone incidents haven't met the threshold for emergency protocols, meaning standard warrant requirements would apply.

What makes this fascinating is how privacy protections extend to technology that feels inherently public. Encrypted drone communications receive the same legal safeguards as traditional wiretaps, proving that judicial oversight adapts to emerging tech rather than becoming obsolete.

The discussion covers how introverts and extroverts have varying needs, but the science is clear: human connection is non-negotiable for mental and physical wellbeing.

Beyond sleep, the core pillars include exercise, quality nutrition (unprocessed foods, adequate protein, vegetables, fruit), stress management through NSDR and physiological sighs, and that crucial social element Santos emphasizes.

His philosophy? Strip away everything that doesn't serve the core mission. That relentless focus separated good from iconic.

DEFMDzBOJPg-2.mp4,"Seven years and one Christmas greeting changed everything. In 2017, Senator Kamala Harris questioned how anyone could say ""Merry Christmas"" while DACA recipients faced deportation uncertainty. Fast forward to 2020—Harris herself posted a festive holiday message with Doug Emhoff, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. The contrast between her 2017 press conference and 2020 video caught attention during Duncan Trussell's conversation on The Joe Rogan Experience. Some called the shift hypocritical, others saw it as politicians being politicians. Either way, the receipts tell an interesting story about messaging and moments. @thejrecompanion breaks it all down.

DEfwvzDS8Pg-1.mp4,"Your brain runs on the same fuel your muscles produce during high-intensity training—and the cognitive benefits are remarkable.

When you cross that 85% max heart rate threshold during sustained effort, lactate floods your system and becomes premium fuel for brain function. The result? A dramatic surge in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—the molecule responsible for memory enhancement, neuron development, and neuroplasticity.

Just six minutes of intense cycling can multiply BDNF levels by 4-5 times, sharpening cognitive performance while simultaneously defending against mental decline and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms.

High-intensity training isn't only transforming your physique and cardiovascular system—it's fundamentally upgrading your brain's hardware.

Meeting standard physical activity guidelines doesn't guarantee better VO2 max. In fact, nearly 40% of people who hit those targets show no cardiovascular improvement whatsoever.

The missing piece? High-intensity interval training (HIIT).

The Norwegian 4x4 protocol stands out as one of the most research-validated approaches for boosting VO2 max:

• 4 minutes at maximum sustainable intensity (85-95% HRmax)
• 3 minutes at lower intensity (zone 1)
• Repeat 4 times

This structured method pushes past the plateau that moderate-intensity exercise alone can't overcome.

The mechanism? Lactate acts as a signaling molecule that triggers GLUT4 transporters to migrate to cell surfaces, actively clearing glucose from blood into muscle tissue. This metabolic boost persists for 48 hours.

Rhonda breaks down the science of lactate's impact on metabolic health and brain function in her latest conversation with Rich Roll on The Rich Roll Podcast.

• Evidence-based strategies to reduce microplastic exposure
• How air pollution accelerates Alzheimer's risk

@foundmyfitness explores a fascinating angle: the physical stress that exercise places on blood vessels actually destroys up to 90% of circulating tumor cells trying to move through the bloodstream. Since metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer deaths, this matters.

The science is compelling across multiple study types—lab research confirms exercise-level shear stress eliminates even drug-resistant cancer cells, animal models show 50-60% reductions in metastasis rates among active mice, and human data links higher activity levels to lower cancer recurrence.

Dr. Kerry Courneya breaks down the full picture in Episode 99: ""The Science of Exercise for Cancer"" on the FoundMyFitness podcast.

@foundr's CEO & Founder @NathanChan sits down with Aimee to explore the unfiltered reality of building a global brand from scratch—the product that sold out overnight, the funding tactics that eliminated the need for investors, and the precise moment she knew there was no turning back from her 9-5.

This conversation delivers the blueprint for turning an idea into an obsession-worthy brand, even when you're starting with nothing but belief and determination.

The approach works by treating lifting like skill work: low reps, full focus on each one, and enough rest to maintain quality movement patterns. This applies equally to men and women, and you can keep workouts efficient by alternating exercises during those longer rest periods.

DGRT1_9O7mF-2.mp4,"The data doesn't lie: physical inactivity kills at the same rate as smoking, heart disease, and diabetes. Yet resistance training remains criminally undervalued.

@foundmyfitness recently testified before the Senate Aging Committee, delivering a wake-up call backed by hard science. The muscle loss statistics alone are staggering - 10% gone by age 50, up to 40% by 70 for many Americans.

But here's what matters most: higher muscle mass slashes mortality risk by 30% through improved insulin sensitivity. Grip strength outperforms blood pressure as a cardiovascular death predictor. The strongest middle-aged adults cut their dementia risk by 42%.

This testimony before @senateaging, made possible by Senator Rick Scott (@flsenrickscott), reframes resistance training from optional fitness activity to essential medical intervention - our most powerful weapon against aging, period.

DGT3gypuK1U-2.mp4,"# The mortality risk of low omega-3s matches smoking—yet most people have never had their levels tested.

@foundmyfitness recently delivered testimony to the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging (@senateaging), highlighting a troubling reality: nutrient deficiencies are killing us as effectively as cigarettes, but without the warning labels or public outcry.

The data she presented is stark:

• 80-90% of Americans have insufficient omega-3 levels, carrying smoking-equivalent mortality risk

• Vitamin D deficiency undermines immune function, brain health, and lifespan—despite being easily fixable

• Magnesium inadequacy affects nearly half the population, damaging DNA repair mechanisms and elevating cancer risk

Meanwhile, ultra-processed foods make up 60% of the American diet—calorie-dense but nutritionally void, engineered for overconsumption rather than nourishment.

Her proposed solution? Treat nutrient deficiencies with the same urgency as the anti-smoking campaigns. Make omega-3 and vitamin D screening routine in preventive care. Research shows that supplementing vitamin D-deficient adults with 4,000 IU daily reversed biological age by almost two years.

The full testimony is now available on the FoundMyFitness YouTube channel. She extends gratitude to Senator Rick Scott (@flsenrickscott) for facilitating this critical conversation.

DGdzwDvuZO0-1.mp4,"Small tweaks to your daily routine could be your best defense against microplastic contamination—@foundmyfitness breaks down the most effective swaps that actually matter.

The strategy? Target the biggest exposure points first. Reverse osmosis filtration tackles tap water contamination head-on. Glass and stainless steel replace plastic bottles and plastic-lined aluminum cans. A reusable mug cuts out the plastic lining found in disposable coffee cups.

The golden rule: heat is the enemy. Never microwave food in plastic containers, reheat takeout in original packaging, or use plastic utensils with hot meals.

Canned goods carry hidden risks too—BPA levels can surge 1,000% after consuming canned soup. Seek BPA-free options or go fresh when possible.

For cooking, she recommends replacing non-stick pans with stainless steel, cast iron, or ceramic, and switching plastic utensils to wood or metal alternatives.

These adjustments address the primary sources of microplastic exposure. Perfection isn't the goal—consistent, practical changes are.

@foundmyfitness breaks down how cognitive pressure from sleep loss, aging, or mental exhaustion actually makes the blood-brain barrier more permeable, creating a window where supplemental creatine can slip through and boost function.

The protocols that work:
• 20g daily for 5 days during sleep deprivation = 10-20% better working memory
• 5g daily for weeks in older adults = sharper recall and mental clarity
• Ongoing research suggests benefits for mood stability, reduced cognitive fatigue, and potential TBI protection

This isn't about everyday supplementation—it's about timing creatine for periods of elevated brain demand when it can actually make a difference.

The trusted environmental health expert who's worked with Lauryn Bosstick and Paul Saladino turned Alex's one-bedroom into a full-on health investigation site 🏠⚠️

Could invisible threats in your living space be the reason you feel off? Brain fog, constant fatigue, unexplained symptoms—sometimes the culprit isn't your body, it's your building 😷

After surviving his own battle with environmental illness, Ryan now helps people detect what's lurking where they live. This @cultureapothecary episode breaks it all down (and Alex promises a vlog with the shocking results coming soon) 🎥

The real issue could be inadequate pituitary signaling, poor testicular response despite normal signaling, or something completely different that actually has a solution beyond permanent TRT.

Comprehensive bloodwork reveals whether you're dealing with a hormone production problem, a signaling problem, or metabolic dysfunction—information that drastically changes your treatment path.

DJFSPnQS3di-2.mp4,"Looking for performance gains without caffeine jitters? The answer might be sitting in your produce aisle. Beetroot extract delivers measurable improvements in endurance, recovery, and cognitive function by ramping up nitric oxide production—meaning better oxygen delivery to both muscles and brain tissue.

The results speak for themselves: athletes taking beetroot juice sharpened their decision-making speed by roughly 4% at rest, thanks to increased blood flow to regions controlling motor function and focus. @DrAndyGalpin strategically deploys blood-flow enhancers like beetroot and citrulline for his athletes during nighttime training blocks and when scheduling demands multiple daily sessions—times when stimulants would sabotage sleep quality.

Here's the problem: less than half the population eats enough nitrate-rich vegetables to maintain optimal NO levels. Supplementing with beetroot juice or citrulline bridges that nutritional gap while supporting vascular function throughout the entire body.

Success doesn't guarantee happiness—and @markmanson breaks down why some people can't hold onto joy even when life looks perfect on paper.

The culprit? Deep-seated beliefs from past trauma that whisper ""you don't deserve this."" These convictions literally drain your capacity for happiness, no matter how much good comes your way.

Most reach for quick fixes—overworking, substances, endless distractions—but these are just temporary patches on a persistent problem. Mark explains that lasting change requires confronting and transforming those core beliefs at their root.

Sexton reveals these agreements focus more on building the relationship than ending it—protecting what matters while you're together, not just when you're apart. Whether you're single, married, or somewhere in between, this conversation exposes the emotional and legal pitfalls that silently destroy relationships, plus the practical tools to avoid them.

Low T often signals deeper health issues lurking beneath the surface: sleep disorders, chronic stress, nutrient gaps, metabolic dysfunction (type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD), endocrine problems (pituitary adenoma, hyperprolactinemia), autoimmune conditions, or genetic developmental disorders.

Early detection changes everything—many cases can be reversed naturally with the right approach.

✅ Advanced lab testing with sensitive assay panels for gold-standard diagnostic accuracy
✅ Expert analysis from specialists who understand the nuances, delivering actionable insights

Huberman, who personally struggles with dairy, pressed for answers on why hard cheeses work differently than milk. The two scientists debated protein needs but ultimately found common ground that applies across all eating styles.

What makes this work isn't perfection. It's presence. It's the willingness to use the one instrument we're all born with but rarely learn to play.

His baby girl doesn't need Grammy-level vocals. She needs the comfort that comes from her dad's sound, delivered with what he calls ""delusional level of vocal confidence.""

That's the real superpower — showing up fully, voice and all, in those quiet moments that matter most.

DK9m1SqK5HP-2.mp4,"Your brain's janitorial system only clocks in during deep sleep—and skipping those night shifts could be costing you more than you think. @ultimatehumanpod breaks down groundbreaking research from UCSF, NIH, and international sleep scientists showing that poor deep sleep in your 40s and 50s raises dementia risk by over 30%.

Here's what's happening: the glymphatic system acts as your brain's waste disposal, flushing out neurotoxins and metabolic debris—but only when you're in deep sleep phases. Miss out consistently, and those toxins pile up, damaging neurons and accelerating cognitive decline.

The data is clear:
- Low REM and deep sleep = higher Alzheimer's risk
- Glymphatic cleaning requires deep sleep to activate
- Your sleep habits now determine brain health decades later

Science-backed solutions:
→ Optimize your environment (pitch black, 65-68°F)
→ Lock in your circadian rhythm with morning sunlight
→ Try magnesium and glycine supplementation
→ Use meditation to deepen sleep quality

Trading sleep for productivity? You might be mortgaging your future cognition for today's output. Deep sleep isn't rest—it's essential maintenance.

From classroom lessons to a sunscreen revolution that caught Blackstone's attention—Holly Thaggard's journey with Supergoop is proof that the best businesses are born from personal pain points, not market research.

A friend's skin cancer diagnosis became the catalyst. A failed school initiative became the foundation. And one bold move at a Vegas trade show changed everything.

Holly shares the raw, unfiltered reality of building Supergoop into a $700M brand now stocked in Sephora and used by celebrities worldwide—including the failures, the pivots, and the moments that tested everything.

Inside this conversation with @foundr:
– The friend's diagnosis that started it all
– Why her original school program didn't work (and what she learned)
– How a Vegas trade show introduction to the Burt's Bees founder shifted her entire trajectory
– The single phone call that landed Supergoop in Sephora—no PR team involved
– Her blueprint for creating a brand with real staying power

For anyone doubting their own path right now, Holly's story is the reminder you need.

These compounds don't just pass through; they disrupt hormones, trigger inflammation, and quietly accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. @ultimatehumanpod breaks down exactly how these exposures stack up and what can actually be done about it.

@foundr sat down with Allison to break down the messy middle: rebranding while pregnant, a Vegas trade show gamble that paid off, outselling Trump and Kim K in trending searches, and a Super Bowl commercial that almost never aired.

The real lessons? They're not in the success — they're in the pivots, the instinct calls, and the moments where quitting would've been easier.

DKVA-SrSK2f-2.mp4,"Over four years, a simple 2,000 IU vitamin D supplement demonstrated the capacity to preserve telomere integrity at a level that equates to slowing biological aging by approximately three years, according to @foundmyfitness.

The VITAL Telomere sub-study—a rigorous, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 1,054 adults aged 50 and older—tracked leukocyte telomere length changes across four years. Telomeres, the protective DNA sequences capping chromosome ends, prevent genomic instability, and their deterioration correlates strongly with aging and chronic disease vulnerability.

Vitamin D's anti-aging mechanisms work through multiple pathways: boosting telomerase activity, minimizing DNA damage, and regulating inflammation via vitamin D receptor–dependent processes.

Evidence supports maintaining serum vitamin D concentrations between 40–60 ng/mL through consistent daily supplementation as a practical approach to decelerating telomere attrition and potentially extending healthspan.

Actually, the real skill is active listening and knowing when to contribute versus when to let the conversation breathe. Courage gets you in the door, but strategic listening keeps you in the room.

His framework cuts through the noise: own your decisions instead of blaming circumstances, move before you feel ready, admit when you're wrong, ignore validation metrics that don't matter to you, and choose discomfort when it means evolution. The difference between these principles and generic advice? They require you to give up the excuses that feel safe. He's not asking if you're motivated—he's asking if you're willing to be honest with yourself about what's actually holding you back.

Haidt's rider-and-elephant metaphor perfectly captures the struggle: your rational mind is the rider attempting control, while your emotional brain—the elephant—actually runs the show. True mastery isn't about dominating the elephant, but becoming skilled at guiding it through meditation, therapy, and when necessary, medication.

DLSi9jCupqc-1.mp4,"L-theanine might be the missing piece to your morning coffee routine. According to research shared by @foundmyfitness, this amino acid transforms caffeine's effects by activating alpha brain waves and boosting calming neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin. The result? Enhanced focus and attention without the jitters that often come with higher caffeine intake. Studies confirm this duo improves performance on mentally demanding tasks while creating what users describe as a ""calm yet focused"" sensation. The recommended ratio is 100-200 mg of L-theanine paired with 100-150 mg of caffeine, taken together since they absorb at similar rates. One important note: L-theanine won't speed up how your body processes caffeine, so timing your last cup before bed still matters.

DLpwOINuAaT-1.mp4,"Dr. Rhonda Patrick (@foundmyfitness) breaks down exactly what she packs for coffee on the go—and it's way more than caffeine. Her portable blend tackles the hidden stressors of travel: compromised gut barriers from planes, microplastic exposure from hotel coffee makers, and the cognitive drain of constant movement. She combines organic freeze-dried instant coffee with 5g L-glutamine for immune-gut protection, hydrolyzed collagen peptides for connective tissue resilience under oxidative stress, and 5g creatine monohydrate split across the day to fuel mitochondrial function and mental sharpness. The strategy: skip sketchy hotel brewing equipment, support your body's defense systems, and maintain performance no matter where you land.

The imperfections don't cancel the beauty of a nation built on protected liberties: voice, worship, home, and hope. That's the real reason to celebrate.

His take? If you're not actually impoverished, Medicaid facilities aren't meant for you. Banking on welfare instead of planning ahead puts your family at risk.

The better path forward:
• Secure long-term care insurance while you can still qualify
• Build enough wealth to self-fund quality care on your terms
• Know the protections already in place—your home and certain retirement accounts are often shielded when one spouse needs nursing support

Bottom line from @daveramsey: have the uncomfortable money talk with your spouse today. Create a plan that safeguards your assets the legal way—no shortcuts, no regrets.

DM3FDPvNy-M-2.mp4,"Every action creates a ripple—we just forget because we can't see it. 🌊

That's the core insight @simonsinek unpacks here: kindness isn't measured, so it fades into the background despite 89% claiming it matters.

The gap? Evidence.

Without tangible proof that our gestures make a difference, we stop making them. We need reinforcement loops for behavior change—not just good intentions.

This product closes that loop by making kindness visible. The consequence of every small act becomes something you can witness, not just hope exists.

Simple concept. Profound shift.

When people can finally see their impact, they lean in harder. The smallest gesture suddenly carries weight because there's proof it landed.

That's how you turn 89% who care into 89% who act. 👏

She was a regular Xylitol gum user for dental health until this discovery changed everything. The solution? Plant-based alternatives like Simply Gum and True Gum, which use natural tree sap instead of synthetic polymers.

For chronic gum chewers, the annual microplastic exposure adds up to tens of thousands of particles—but unlike many sources of plastic contamination, this one's completely within your control.

DMLnUU3J3Ow-1.mp4,"Could weight loss drugs work better at lower doses? Dr. Ben Bikman (@benbikmanphd) thinks the answer might be yes. While GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide have proven incredibly effective, the standard high doses come with concerning risks—including doubled rates of suicidal behavior, tripled depression risk, and increased age-related macular degeneration. Bikman's alternative approach involves intermittent micro-dosing over roughly 90 days to help reset eating behaviors and manage hunger without the severe side effects. Some researchers even speculate these medications could have longevity benefits beyond weight loss alone. @foundmyfitness dives deeper into this strategic use of GLP-1 drugs in the latest episode with Dr. Bikman.

Without legal and financial ties, you're each operating solo—meaning she could leave with the car you bought her, no questions asked. Marriage changes that equation through divorce proceedings and asset division. But here's the deeper truth: it's not really about the car. When you're legally bound, you build toward a shared vision—that house with golden rocking chairs on the porch at 92. Real commitment forces you to aim at the future together, and that unified direction compounds into wealth over time.

This conversation unveils the mission where Andrew's cover was compromised, the psychological tactics spies use to build trust with targets, and how CIA mental training can eliminate mental clutter in everyday life.

The truth? It's already woven into everything you do—and @themelrobbinspodcast is here to prove it.

Mel Robbins sits down with musician @philcookmusic to dismantle the lie that creativity is reserved for a select few. They reveal how the small adjustments you make—whether it's perfecting Friday night pizza, improving your grandpa's fishing knots, or tweaking grandma's old recipes—are all acts of creative expression.

The real question isn't whether you're creative. It's whether you're paying attention to the nudges: that hobby you abandoned, the skill you keep thinking about, the thing that won't leave you alone.

Those aren't distractions. They're invitations.

After building @outdoorvoices into a $100M brand by 30, she faced a very public unraveling. Most founders would disappear. Ty came back stronger with @getjoggy and @tyb.xyz, proving that resilience beats perfection every time.

@foundr sat down with her to unpack the real strategies behind her second act—the unglamorous truths about modern DTC, how she's building deeper relationships with customers instead of chasing vanity metrics, and the brutal lessons from her first company that shaped everything she's doing now.

This conversation covers:
- The fatal flaws in today's direct-to-consumer model
- How to transform casual customers into ride-or-die advocates
- Behind-the-scenes of the Outdoor Voices rise and fall
- Why founders showing up authentically is non-negotiable
- The boundaries she's protecting as she scales again

This isn't your typical founder advice. This is three people who've built empires from scratch, now revealing the exact frameworks that separate companies doing $0 from those hitting $59M.

The conversation tears into:

- Which business game everyone gets completely wrong
- The only frameworks that'll survive AI disruption
- How pricing alone can become your biggest growth lever
- The real way founders build unshakeable confidence
- Why most people confuse leverage with passive income

Blue zones show us it's possible. Science shows us how to optimize it.

For context: breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women during their lifetime, making even modest risk elevation significant. Women carrying genetic predispositions or dealing with factors like obesity face amplified impact from alcohol consumption. This information enables women to base health decisions on established science rather than assumptions about ""moderate"" drinking being harmless.

This mechanism reaches the brain too, which is why she has her parents supplementing with it daily as a defense against neurodegeneration. From traumatic brain injury to Alzheimer's, conditions rooted in oxidative stress may be countered by this compound. While supplements work, broccoli sprouts pack 100 times more sulforaphane precursor than fully grown broccoli, making them an incredibly concentrated whole-food option.

The key differences: anterior pelvic tilt with a hard arch and pushed-out stomach sets up the pre-stretch. Minimal knee bend stays constant throughout. The descent requires a slow butt-back movement with knees tracking slightly back. Chest stays up at the bottom to maintain tension—caving forward loses everything. That painful hamstring stretch at the bottom? That's the goal.

As one of the world's leading AI safety experts, Dr Roman has dedicated decades to studying what happens when artificial intelligence surpasses human control. His conversation with @thediaryofaceopodcast explores the uncomfortable truths most people avoid.

The discussion tackles:

- A 99% job displacement scenario by 2030
- Why containing AI may be fundamentally impossible
- Evidence supporting the simulation hypothesis
- The coming AI-driven global arms race
- The extinction-level risks of superintelligence

Unlike most topics that eventually offer clarity, AI only generates deeper, more unsettling questions. It's the single most disruptive force of this generation, which is exactly why conversations like this matter.

Dr Roman's arguments about living in a simulation became significantly more convincing by the end.

DOV3jIijWNS-1.mp4,"According to @hubermanlab, there's one simple habit that delivers more health benefits per minute than almost anything else: stepping outside for morning sunlight. Just 5-10 minutes transforms your biology for an entire day—boosting mood, focus, alertness, immune function, and setting you up for better sleep that night. The catch? You need to be outdoors (not behind a window) and remove your sunglasses, though prescription glasses are fine. He emphasizes this practice matters even more on cloudy days, since indoor lighting can't provide the photon levels your body needs to regulate circadian rhythms properly. When your internal clock is aligned, everything else—exercise, nutrition, hydration—becomes easier to execute. Without adequate daylight exposure, even minimal screen time at night disrupts sleep. The best part? It's free, takes barely any time, and feels good. Most people's circadian biology is misaligned, but getting morning light within the first couple hours of waking fixes it.

Launch a side catering gig, scale up to a food truck, and let the profits fund the brick-and-mortar location years down the road—all without gambling the house or the income.

Roughly half of fish sold in stores is mislabeled, meaning you're not getting what you paid for. Industrial fishing operations are destroying ocean floors, and some seafood (especially farm shrimp from Southeast Asia) contains undisclosed chemicals added purely to increase weight. His current approach: limit seafood to 1-2x weekly, stick to smaller short-lived species, take chlorella alongside fish to bind toxins, prioritize oysters and shellfish for unique nutrients, and when eating out, choose sushi—but avoid escolar (white tuna), which is banned in Japan for causing serious digestive issues.

His recommendation? Swap to sheep's milk varieties like pecorino, which naturally contains A2 proteins and a gut-friendly profile similar to Parmesan. He challenges anyone dealing with low energy, poor focus, or stubborn weight to eliminate all dairy (ghee gets a pass) for a few weeks and monitor the results. For Dave personally, cow's milk causes widespread inflammation, while sheep's milk works with his system. The key is testing what your unique biology actually tolerates. 🧠

DOmyQCckkyX-2.mp4,"The real risk isn't quitting your job—it's staying too long after your side project already proves it works.

@foundr's founder was stuck between two worlds: an IT career offering security and a magazine business gaining serious momentum. Revenue was flowing. Customers were buying. Growth was happening. Yet fear kept him anchored to that desk job, convinced he was playing it safe.

A mentor's words shattered that illusion: ""The longer you wait, the more money you lose.""

That reframe changed everything. He wasn't protecting his future by holding onto his paycheck—he was actively limiting it. Split focus meant split results. Within weeks of going all in, the business exploded.

The conversation around entrepreneurship obsesses over jumping too soon, but rarely addresses the opposite trap: staying comfortable while your breakthrough waits on the other side of commitment.

Meanwhile, Italian food culture preserves not just nutritional value but also reduces inflammation through traditional farming practices and mindful eating rituals centered on family and community.

No business journey is smooth sailing. The difference makers aren't the ones chasing what feels good in the moment—they're the ones who've mastered playing to their advantages when obstacles hit.

DP3GfMxDIyR-1.mp4,"Medical research has a massive blind spot—and it's costing women their health.

Less than 2% of research focuses on female-specific conditions, despite women being half the population. The result? Decades of misdiagnosis, dismissal, and gaps in care.

@thediaryofaceopodcast brings together four powerhouse experts to expose what's broken and how we fix it:

@drstacysims - exercise physiologist and nutrition scientist transforming female performance.

@nataliecrawfordmd - fertility doctor helping women understand their bodies and cycles.

@drmaryclaire - menopause expert and creator of The Galveston Diet for hormone balance.

@drvondawright - orthopaedic surgeon and longevity researcher guiding women stay strong for life.

Inside this conversation:

- What's really happening to women's hormones at different life stages?
- Why do so many women feel unheard by their doctors?
- Is birth control doing more harm than good?
- What doctors still get wrong about menopause and fertility?
- Why understanding your cycle could change your health forever…

The most striking takeaway? How often women are dismissed or misdiagnosed—and how much we still don't know.

This isn't just a women's issue. When half the population doesn't get proper care, everyone suffers.

Part 2 dives into the emotional, social, and relational dimensions of women's health.

DPLU_dPDPv3-1.mp4,"# Three minds, one impossible question: what if everything we've been told about life's meaning is wrong?

A psychiatrist who sees people at rock bottom, a Christian philosopher defending divine purpose, and an atheist thinker dismantling comfortable truths walked into the same room.

@thediaryofaceopodcast wasn't looking for easy answers when he sat down with Dr K (@healthygamer_gg), Greg Koukl, and Alex O'Connor (@cosmicskeptic).

Dr K brings insight from working directly with those who've lost their sense of direction, translating their pain into wisdom the rest of us desperately need.

Greg argues that meaning isn't something we create in our heads, it's embedded in reality by something greater than ourselves.

Alex challenges both sides, questioning whether meaning exists at all or if we're just telling ourselves stories to feel better.

The conversation cuts through surface-level takes on why young people are struggling with purpose, why traditional structures are crumbling, and what's actually happening beneath the cultural shift.

They tackled the hard stuff: invented versus discovered meaning, whether this generation is uniquely directionless, religion's actual role in human flourishing, and how our terror of death dictates everything.

No one left with all the answers, but the collision of worldviews created something more valuable than certainty.

The truth about what sugar does to your body might change everything you thought you knew about food.

@robertlustigmd returns to @thediaryofaceopodcast after his first episode reached over 5 million views—and the audience demanded more answers.

As a world-renowned glucose expert, Dr Lustig has dedicated his career to exposing the real dangers of sugar and ultra-processed foods through his clinical work with thousands of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disease patients.

This conversation cuts through the confusion around modern nutrition.

Topics explored:

- The science behind sugar addiction
- How ultra-processed foods actually rewire the brain
- The connection between lifestyle choices and 95% of Alzheimer's cases
- Sugar's surprising role in depression

Dr Lustig breaks down complex health science into actionable steps anyone can follow.

His message goes beyond calories and weight loss—he connects sugar consumption directly to brain function, aging, and lifespan.

The episode reveals how daily food choices are silently determining long-term health outcomes.

For anyone questioning what their diet is really doing to them, this discussion provides crucial answers.

DPhK0AsjChU-2.mp4,"The hidden epidemic affecting millions: obstructive sleep apnea silently damages the brain while sufferers remain completely unaware. @foundmyfitness breaks down the neurodegenerative cascade triggered by this condition and why immediate intervention matters.

The numbers tell a stark story—1 in 4 men and 1 in 15 women have it, yet diagnosis rates remain shockingly low. Meanwhile, severe cases drive cognitive decline risk up 26% and significantly increase Alzheimer's susceptibility.

Two mechanisms destroy brain health simultaneously: the fragmentation of sleep architecture (obliterating deep and REM phases) and repeated oxygen deprivation during apnea events, which generates damaging oxidative stress and inflammation throughout neural tissue.

Treatment works. CPAP therapy, mandibular advancement devices, and strategic weight loss can reverse this trajectory and preserve long-term cognitive function.

@lewishowes sat down with @hansvestberg and walked away with a masterclass in servant leadership that every entrepreneur needs to hear.

The lesson that hit different? Leadership isn't about how many people follow you. It's about how many people RISE because of you.

7 game-changing insights from their conversation:

✨Know yourself before you lead others
✨Write your ""boss contract"" with a clear vision before you start
✨Always do more than expected
✨Replace control with curiosity
✨Focus on what only you can do
✨Create a vision people can own
✨Leave it better than you found it

Real leadership energy: You walk in the room and people feel LIFTED, not drained. You build something that outlives your title.

Congratulations Hans on an incredible career and the lasting impact you've made as a global leader 📱

DPpAx0sEvnl-1.mp4,"That melatonin supplement you're taking? The actual dose inside could be wildly different from what's printed on the bottle—and there's a scientific reason why. @foundmyfitness breaks down the manufacturing reality behind melatonin's dose inconsistency, explaining why quality brands sometimes intentionally add more than the label claims.

Here's what's actually happening: supplement regulations require products to contain their labeled dose until expiration (usually 2-3 years out), but melatonin degrades naturally over time. Reputable manufacturers compensate by adding extra upfront—sometimes 40-60% more—knowing it will decrease to the accurate amount by the expiration date.

So that 5mg bottle might actually start at 7-8mg when fresh, gradually declining to 5mg as it ages. This overage strategy is how trustworthy brands navigate melatonin's chemical instability while staying compliant.

The takeaway for anyone using melatonin: dose variability is real, and understanding this helps optimize your sleep protocol with more predictable results.

DPuGmV0EtKh-1.mp4,"The connection between Federal Reserve policies and rising homelessness rates explained through one economist's breakdown 📊

When money supply expands but housing supply doesn't keep pace, the math becomes devastating for those on fixed incomes. @icedcoffeehour breaks down how monetary inflation directly impacts America's most vulnerable populations.

The numbers don't lie: as purchasing power erodes, the gap between wages and housing costs creates an impossible equation for millions.

DPuOUO9EoP--2.mp4,"Robert Kiyosaki made a power move that turned heads—he bought his house with gold instead of cash. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author didn't just preach alternative wealth strategies, he lived them. While most people finance homes through traditional mortgages, Kiyosaki leveraged physical gold to secure his property, proving his philosophy that precious metals hold real value beyond paper currency.

DPvYGMBAILJ-1.mp4,"Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson just revealed how his parents' deaths completely transformed his understanding of mortality—and it's nothing like what you'd expect from one of Earth's most famous astrophysicists.

The Director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't shy away from the hard stuff. In this raw conversation with @thediaryofaceopodcast, he opens up about grief, purpose, and why he believes death is actually what makes living meaningful.

From questioning why 80% of Gen Z trust astrology to unpacking alien existence and whether we're living in a simulation, @neildegrassetyson breaks down the biggest questions with the kind of honesty that makes you rethink everything.

They dive into interplanetary travel, the secret to happiness, and whether science can redefine how we see purpose.

What hits different is watching someone who's dedicated over 35 years to understanding the cosmos admit that his most profound lessons came from loss, not the stars.

This isn't your typical science talk—it's about finding meaning when everything you thought you understood gets flipped upside down.

Comment 'Neil' for the full conversation.

@chriswillx cuts through the illusion: those status symbols and difficult conquests we obsess over? They're frequently empty once you actually get them. The challenge itself created the appeal, not any real substance beneath it.

What actually matters: personal growth, authentic relationships, inner peace, real wisdom. These transform you from the inside out and create lasting fulfillment.

The distinction matters. Meaningful goals will challenge you, absolutely. But exhausting yourself for things that only look impressive to others? That's wasted energy on a mirage.

Choose your battles based on what genuinely enriches your life, not what society tells you to chase.

Light, sound, touch—your nervous system transforms these into electrical signals that become perceptions. Those perceptions mix with memories to create emotions, behaviors, and eventually thoughts. Dr. Groh's explanation might be the clearest framework for understanding what thinking actually is.

The full conversation covers the neuroscience of focus, task switching, and the mechanics of thought—all backed by real data. Worth checking out on the Huberman Lab podcast.

Inside this conversation:

- A 5 second memory improvement hack
- How to spot when someone's lying
- The signals you're sending without realizing
- Why rejection fear stops most people cold

Pearlman's spent decades mastering psychology and body language, turning human behaviour into a readable skill. He reveals that communication starts long before words are spoken—it's in how we think, connect, and what we leave unsaid.

The patterns are always there. Most just don't know where to look.

DQTiFv9DN-Z-1.mp4,"After the overwhelming response to part 1, @thediaryofaceopodcast brought back four world-class experts to continue the conversation on women's health—and this time, they're diving into training, nutrition, and recovery.

The lineup: @drstacysims (exercise physiologist and nutrition scientist), @nataliecrawfordmd (fertility doctor), @drmaryclaire (menopause expert), and @drvondawright (orthopaedic surgeon and longevity researcher).

For too long, women's health research has taken a backseat to male-centered data, leaving women without clear answers about their own bodies.

This episode tackles the questions that matter: whether women should adjust training based on their cycle, what's really happening during perimenopause and menopause, how heavy lifting protects both brain and bones, which exercises support female longevity, and how to safeguard hormones and energy through aging.

The host reflects on how much he—and most men—didn't understand about the complexity and resilience of women's bodies until these conversations took place.

It's a perspective shift for anyone who wants to better support the women around them or simply learn what's been overlooked for decades.

DQ_TqX5DDe8-1.mp4,"Tim Ferriss built an empire teaching people how to work less—then realized he couldn't stop working himself.

Through two decades of deconstructing human performance, @timferriss uncovered an uncomfortable truth: the same drive that fuels extraordinary achievement might be running from something deeper.

Their conversation goes beyond productivity hacks and life optimization. It digs into why some people can't sit still, even when they've already won. Therapy helped Tim connect dots between his relentless output and patterns formed long before he wrote 'The 4-Hour Workweek'—the book that changed how millions view their relationship with work.

Inside this episode:

- The psychology behind our optimization obsession
- How early experiences create a need for control
- Trauma as fuel for high performance
- Why slowing down feels impossible for achievers
- Whether growth requires constant pressure

Tim pioneered long-form conversations before the format was validated, proving depth could capture attention. That risk created space for what this account does today—standing on foundations others built.

The glymphatic system—your brain's waste removal network—works most efficiently when you're lying on your side during deep sleep, not on your back or stomach. This same drainage system affects facial appearance and eye puffiness too. He shares a clever positioning hack that people actually use to stay sleeping sideways throughout the night, plus explains why dozing off in a chair never feels as refreshing as proper reclined sleep.

The cisterna chyli—a lymph reservoir in your abdomen—acts as a collection point for fluid that needs to move through your system. When diaphragmatic breathing is performed correctly, it creates pressure differences that essentially pump lymph from this reservoir up to the vessels below your clavicles, where it re-enters your bloodstream. This isn't just about reducing facial puffiness or leg swelling; it's critical for immune function and clearing inflammation from organs and brain tissue. While walking and lymphatic massage help, strategic breathing sessions throughout your day can drive significant lymphatic flow, especially during periods of low physical activity. Full protocols and the complete biology breakdown are available on the Huberman Lab podcast at hubermanlab.com with timestamps for easy navigation.

True honor lives in the details: how we treat them, the quality of their existence, and the appreciation we carry when they fuel our bodies. This is what intentional living actually means.

@thediaryofaceopodcast sits down with researcher and author @brenebrown, whose groundbreaking work on shame and courage has reached millions through her nearly 30-million-view TED Talk.

After spending over twenty years researching human connection, Brené unpacks the invisible forces that keep people trapped in cycles of hiding and pretending.

The conversation explores the silent weight of shame, the relationship damage caused by emotional walls, pathways to rebuilding broken trust, and why the need to control everything often backfires.

At a time when so many feel disconnected and inadequate, Brené offers clarity on the patterns most people feel but struggle to name.

This episode digs into the question of what drives someone to dedicate their life to helping others face their deepest fears—and what shifts when we choose to do the same.

For anyone who's ever wondered why fear shows up the way it does, this one's worth the watch.

DQzFBHrCa0n-2.mp4,"Dr. Mike breaks down the most overlooked lateral raise mistakes that could be holding back your shoulder gains. First up: arm position matters, but consistency matters more—pick an elbow angle that feels right and stick with it every session. Second, this is a shoulder isolation movement, so cut out the momentum and body English (trap involvement is totally fine though). Third game-changer: don't fear going above parallel or even overhead if your joints allow it—that ""dangerous above horizontal"" warning is mostly bro-science. Finally, the lowering phase is where serious growth happens, so control those eccentrics instead of just dropping the weight. Ready to build boulder shoulders? @drmikeclips recommends the @rpstrength RP Hypertrophy App for science-based programming.

The issue isn't just blue light or late-night stimulation. It's about association. When your bed doubles as an entertainment center or work station, your brain gets confused about what that space is actually for.

Over time, your body loses the automatic connection between your bedroom and deep, restorative sleep. The result? Lying awake longer and waking up more throughout the night.

Another critical insight: amino acids are the actual building blocks, not protein itself. Collagen, elastin, immune cells, and tissue repair all require amino acids at the foundational level.

DRS2lhWCmz2-1.mp4,"Dr. Kevin Tracey breaks down the inflammatory reflex with @dave.asprey—revealing how 200,000 vagus nerve fibers control cytokine activity, metabolic function, and emotional stability through electrical signaling.

When vagal pathways lose sensitivity, inflammation spirals, HRV drops, and neurotransmitter balance collapses. This conversation explores the science behind neural communication, what genuine neuromodulation actually requires, and which recovery methods (cold exposure, breathwork, HRV training, targeted electrical stimulation) strengthen the nervous system without adding stress.

Asprey and Tracey dive into why vagus nerve dysfunction quietly undermines immunity, energy output, and long-term brain performance—and how restoring proper neural control changes everything.

Comment ""vagus"" for the episode.

@ultimatehumanpod explains how a common gene variant (MTHFR) prevents many pregnant women from processing standard folic acid supplements, potentially triggering the very anxiety and depression these supplements are meant to prevent. The body needs methylfolate instead, and prescription folinic acid is now being recognized as a game-changer for both postpartum depression and autism.

This could change prenatal care forever.

DRf10XoDnR2-2.mp4,"Even modest weight loss delivers major joint protection—just 11 pounds can slash knee osteoarthritis risk by over 50% in overweight women, according to research shared by @foundmyfitness.

The dual threat comes from mechanical stress and metabolic damage: each extra pound multiplies knee joint pressure by four, while excess fat tissue actively releases inflammatory molecules that break down cartilage.

Obesity increases osteoarthritis risk by 28%, jumping to 42% when both high BMI and abdominal fat are present.

The remedy? Movement becomes medicine when weight decreases—less force on joints, reduced inflammation, and renewed ability to stay active.

He explains that testosterone and thyroid function are the actual drivers behind how your body processes fuel and stores fat. When these hormone systems decline, your metabolism shifts into conservation mode—holding onto belly fat as a protective mechanism rather than burning it off.

Optimizing testosterone helps maintain lean tissue, stable glucose levels, and cognitive sharpness. A functioning thyroid ensures your cells use energy efficiently instead of stockpiling it. When both operate in sync, your body finally gets the signal to release stubborn fat.

Hormones run the show. Fix the signals, and the physical changes catch up.

Short wavelength light from LED bulbs may be damaging mitochondria, while longer wavelengths actually help repair them. Incandescent bulbs naturally emit the full spectrum your cells need. Morning sunlight exposure becomes even more critical when you understand it's protecting your mitochondria from artificial light damage throughout the day.

The evening routine matters too: dimming LEDs at night isn't just about sleep quality, it's about giving your mitochondria a break. Dr. Jeffery shares zero-cost and low-cost protocols to optimize light exposure for cellular health, plus the real science behind red light devices.
