Zero industry connections. That's all @aimeesmalex had when she walked away from corporate life to launch @oddmuselondon.

Fast forward to today: she's built a multi-million dollar fashion empire that's been copied by industry giants like PrettyLittleThing—and she's fought back to protect what she created.

@foundr's CEO & Founder @NathanChan sits down with Aimee to explore the unfiltered reality of building a global brand from scratch—the product that sold out overnight, the funding tactics that eliminated the need for investors, and the precise moment she knew there was no turning back from her 9-5.

This conversation delivers the blueprint for turning an idea into an obsession-worthy brand, even when you're starting with nothing but belief and determination.

While everyone's searching for the perfect lullaby playlist or white noise machine, he's mastered a 5-minute sleep technique using nothing but his voice — no words, no technology, just pure human connection.

What makes this work isn't perfection. It's presence. It's the willingness to use the one instrument we're all born with but rarely learn to play.

His baby girl doesn't need Grammy-level vocals. She needs the comfort that comes from her dad's sound, delivered with what he calls ""delusional level of vocal confidence.""

That's the real superpower — showing up fully, voice and all, in those quiet moments that matter most.

Less than 2% of research focuses on female-specific conditions, despite women being half the population. The result? Decades of misdiagnosis, dismissal, and gaps in care.

@thediaryofaceopodcast brings together four powerhouse experts to expose what's broken and how we fix it:

@drstacysims - exercise physiologist and nutrition scientist transforming female performance.

@nataliecrawfordmd - fertility doctor helping women understand their bodies and cycles.

@drmaryclaire - menopause expert and creator of The Galveston Diet for hormone balance.

@drvondawright - orthopaedic surgeon and longevity researcher guiding women stay strong for life.

Inside this conversation:

- What's really happening to women's hormones at different life stages?
- Why do so many women feel unheard by their doctors?
- Is birth control doing more harm than good?
- What doctors still get wrong about menopause and fertility?
- Why understanding your cycle could change your health forever…

The most striking takeaway? How often women are dismissed or misdiagnosed—and how much we still don't know.

This isn't just a women's issue. When half the population doesn't get proper care, everyone suffers.

Part 2 dives into the emotional, social, and relational dimensions of women's health.

The key insight: some individuals can't regulate starchy carbohydrate intake once they begin eating them, linked to hypothalamic function he's explored in depth on his podcast. Combined with cardiovascular and resistance training, this method has helped numerous people shed significant fat and sustain those results long-term. While vegans and vegetarians would need modifications and any weight loss ultimately requires caloric deficit, the satiating power of quality proteins makes adherence dramatically more achievable for many.

The math is simple but alarming: governments fund debt repayment through taxation, but there's a breaking point where tax rates trigger economic forces that actually make debt harder to repay. According to Friedberg, we've already passed that line.

@impacttheory sits down with David Friedberg to explore what happens when a nation exceeds its natural debt capacity.
