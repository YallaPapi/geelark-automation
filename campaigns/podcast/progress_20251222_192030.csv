Former Secret Service agent Evy Poumpouras breaks down why action beats analysis paralysis every time.

Her perspective? Most people get stuck planning for every scenario that might never happen.

Where do you stand—team calculated risk or team perfect timing?

Mental resilience operates like muscle hypertrophy: adaptation requires progressive overload. Choosing difficulty voluntarily, not reactively, triggers distinct neurological development that compounds over time.

What separates those who endure from those who transcend? The latter doesn't wait for hardship to arrive—they pursue it systematically, building what some call a ""mental callus"" through deliberate exposure.

The distinction matters: forced discomfort versus chosen discomfort creates different neural pathways. One is survival. The other is evolution.

Researchers have identified specific brain regions linked to sustained will—proof that resilience isn't inherited personality, but constructed through repeated decision-making patterns.

Every choice reinforces a trajectory. Every action sets a precedent.

He shares a clever positioning hack that people actually use to stay sleeping sideways throughout the night, plus explains why dozing off in a chair never feels as refreshing as proper reclined sleep.

Her husband has made it his go-to protocol for better sleep quality.

The key? Timing the cold plunge several hours before bed, not right before. She and @DrAndyGalpin dive deeper into sleep optimization tactics in their latest FoundMyFitness podcast conversation.
