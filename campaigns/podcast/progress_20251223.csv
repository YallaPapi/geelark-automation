Fast forward to 2020—Harris herself posted a festive holiday message with Doug Emhoff, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. The contrast between her 2017 press conference and 2020 video caught attention during Duncan Trussell's conversation on The Joe Rogan Experience. Some called the shift hypocritical, others saw it as politicians being politicians. Either way, the receipts tell an interesting story about messaging and moments. @thejrecompanion breaks it all down.

The cisterna chyli—a lymph reservoir in your abdomen—acts as a collection point for fluid that needs to move through your system. When diaphragmatic breathing is performed correctly, it creates pressure differences that essentially pump lymph from this reservoir up to the vessels below your clavicles, where it re-enters your bloodstream. This isn't just about reducing facial puffiness or leg swelling; it's critical for immune function and clearing inflammation from organs and brain tissue. While walking and lymphatic massage help, strategic breathing sessions throughout your day can drive significant lymphatic flow, especially during periods of low physical activity. Full protocols and the complete biology breakdown are available on the Huberman Lab podcast at hubermanlab.com with timestamps for easy navigation.

The same plastic lining found in soup cans exists in most aluminum beverage and food containers, from sodas to sparkling water. Research shows drinking from BPA-lined cans can spike blood pressure 16-fold versus glass bottles, with urinary concentrations at these levels correlating to hormonal disruptions. The solution isn't complicated: swapping canned products for alternatives in glass, cartons, or fresh options significantly cuts BPA exposure and its associated long-term health risks.
