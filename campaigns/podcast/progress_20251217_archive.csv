The discussion reveals surprising findings: Americans who react badly to gluten often have no issues eating bread in Europe—potentially due to wheat variety differences. Gardner also addresses the viral claim about raw dairy reversing lactose intolerance, sharing data from his short-term studies. Huberman, who personally struggles with dairy, pressed for answers on why hard cheeses work differently than milk. The two scientists debated protein needs but ultimately found common ground that applies across all eating styles. Gardner's ""food interventionist"" approach examines how different diets actually affect weight, inflammation, and metabolic health through rigorous testing rather than speculation.

Women carrying genetic predispositions or dealing with factors like obesity face amplified impact from alcohol consumption.

The lineup: @drstacysims (exercise physiologist and nutrition scientist), @nataliecrawfordmd (fertility doctor), @drmaryclaire (menopause expert), and @drvondawright (orthopaedic surgeon and longevity researcher).

For too long, women's health research has taken a backseat to male-centered data, leaving women without clear answers about their own bodies.

This episode tackles the questions that matter: whether women should adjust training based on their cycle, what's really happening during perimenopause and menopause, how heavy lifting protects both brain and bones, which exercises support female longevity, and how to safeguard hormones and energy through aging.

The host reflects on how much he—and most men—didn't understand about the complexity and resilience of women's bodies until these conversations took place.

It's a perspective shift for anyone who wants to better support the women around them or simply learn what's been overlooked for decades.

Andrew Bustamante returns as the third most-viewed guest on @thediaryofaceopodcast, but this time he brings his wife Jihi—a former CIA targeter who decided which individuals were captured or eliminated while Andrew operated undercover in the field.

Their combined expertise creates an unprecedented look inside intelligence operations that rarely see daylight.

This conversation unveils the mission where Andrew's cover was compromised, the psychological tactics spies use to build trust with targets, and how CIA mental training can eliminate mental clutter in everyday life.

Jihi and Andrew share previously untold stories about CIA recruitment, interrogation reversals, and what happens when influential figures need information suppressed.

Two former intelligence officers. One raw conversation.

After building @outdoorvoices into a $100M brand by 30, she faced a very public unraveling. Most founders would disappear. Ty came back stronger with @getjoggy and @tyb.xyz, proving that resilience beats perfection every time.

@foundr sat down with her to unpack the real strategies behind her second act—the unglamorous truths about modern DTC, how she's building deeper relationships with customers instead of chasing vanity metrics, and the brutal lessons from her first company that shaped everything she's doing now.

This conversation covers:
- The fatal flaws in today's direct-to-consumer model
- How to transform casual customers into ride-or-die advocates
- Behind-the-scenes of the Outdoor Voices rise and fall
- Why founders showing up authentically is non-negotiable
- The boundaries she's protecting as she scales again

Raw, tactical, and refreshingly real—this episode hits different if you're in the trenches building something.

Her portable blend tackles the hidden stressors of travel: compromised gut barriers from planes, microplastic exposure from hotel coffee makers, and the cognitive drain of constant movement. She combines organic freeze-dried instant coffee with 5g L-glutamine for immune-gut protection, hydrolyzed collagen peptides for connective tissue resilience under oxidative stress, and 5g creatine monohydrate split across the day to fuel mitochondrial function and mental sharpness. The strategy: skip sketchy hotel brewing equipment, support your body's defense systems, and maintain performance no matter where you land.

Ed sits down with @charlesduhigg to explore why most people talk past each other—and what the best communicators do differently. This isn't about speaking louder or using fancy words. It's about understanding the psychology behind conversations that actually matter.

Charles reveals the frameworks that separate surface-level chatter from deep, meaningful exchanges that build trust and influence. From mastering active listening to knowing when body language says more than words, this episode delivers tactical strategies anyone can use immediately.

The conversation covers mirroring techniques that create instant rapport, the art of asking questions that open people up, how introverts can leverage their natural strengths, and why teaching kids these skills early changes everything. Ed and Charles also tackle the tough stuff—navigating difficult conversations, setting boundaries without burning bridges, and recognizing when timing makes all the difference.

Real connection isn't optional anymore. It's the skill that determines who leads, who influences, and who builds relationships that last.
