The imperfections don't cancel the beauty of a nation built on protected liberties: voice, worship, home, and hope. That's the real reason to celebrate.

The unvaccinated became society's scapegoat while officials painted with broad strokes and incomplete data. Fast forward to today, and the ""conspiracy theorists"" don't look so crazy anymore.

Derek and Joe dissect how quickly certainty replaced curiosity, and why waiting for complete information matters more than rushing to judgment.

Dr. Glen Jeffery joins @hubermanlab to break down how the light sources in your home could be working against your cellular health—and what to do about it.

Short wavelength light from LED bulbs may be damaging mitochondria, while longer wavelengths actually help repair them. Incandescent bulbs naturally emit the full spectrum your cells need. Morning sunlight exposure becomes even more critical when you understand it's protecting your mitochondria from artificial light damage throughout the day.

The evening routine matters too: dimming LEDs at night isn't just about sleep quality, it's about giving your mitochondria a break. Dr. Jeffery shares zero-cost and low-cost protocols to optimize light exposure for cellular health, plus the real science behind red light devices.

Research from @foundmyfitness reveals that children with autism can't detoxify BPA like neurotypical kids can, with bound BPA levels 15 times higher in their systems. The chemical acts as a xenoestrogen, hijacking normal hormone signaling during critical brain development windows. ADHD, anxiety, and depression rates also climb with prenatal exposure. The fix? Ditch plastic water bottles and never heat plastic—heating increases BPA leaching by up to 55x. Multiple studies confirm this isn't just correlation.

His solution? He partnered with @essentiaorganicmattress to engineer The Dave Asprey Upgrade—a toxin-free performance system built specifically for optimal regeneration. The specs include EMF-blocking informed quartz, Beyond Latex Foam that enhances circulation by eliminating pressure points, and active cooling technology that keeps your body in deep and REM sleep longer. It's recovery optimization while you're unconscious. Head to myessentia.com and use code DAVE for an extra $100 off The Dave Asprey Upgrade.

Instead of waiting to feel worthy after achieving something, he teaches the power of touching your dreams first—visiting that house, test driving that car, walking through that business space—to eliminate imposter syndrome before success even arrives. Your brain needs to recognize the dream as familiar territory, not foreign ground. When you physically interact with what you're building toward, you're programming your mind to see it as inevitable rather than impossible.

The difference between average and elite isn't genetics:
✔️ It's willpower.
✔️ It's resilience.
✔️ It's refusing to stop when your mind is screaming to.

Real transformation happens in the moments when everyone around you keeps going while their minds beg them to quit—that's where internal strength is forged.

For context: breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women during their lifetime, making even modest risk elevation significant. Women carrying genetic predispositions or dealing with factors like obesity face amplified impact from alcohol consumption.
