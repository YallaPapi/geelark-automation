She expresses profound gratitude for a husband whose dedication to America goes beyond celebration—it's a daily commitment to defending the freedoms written into our Constitution. His passion for this country, she notes, reminds us all why the right to speak freely matters, even when we disagree.

The imperfections don't cancel the beauty of a nation built on protected liberties: voice, worship, home, and hope. That's the real reason to celebrate.

Her message closes with gratitude to God for freedom, for America, and for a partner who gives everything to preserve both.

House reports are now revealing what couldn't be said out loud during the pandemic's peak: natural immunity held its ground, and vaccine transmission prevention fell short of the bold promises plastered across headlines.

The unvaccinated became society's scapegoat while officials painted with broad strokes and incomplete data. Fast forward to today, and the ""conspiracy theorists"" don't look so crazy anymore.

Derek and Joe dissect how quickly certainty replaced curiosity, and why waiting for complete information matters more than rushing to judgment.

Dr. Glen Jeffery joins @hubermanlab to break down how the light sources in your home could be working against your cellular health—and what to do about it.

Short wavelength light from LED bulbs may be damaging mitochondria, while longer wavelengths actually help repair them. Incandescent bulbs naturally emit the full spectrum your cells need. Morning sunlight exposure becomes even more critical when you understand it's protecting your mitochondria from artificial light damage throughout the day.

The evening routine matters too: dimming LEDs at night isn't just about sleep quality, it's about giving your mitochondria a break. Dr. Jeffery shares zero-cost and low-cost protocols to optimize light exposure for cellular health, plus the real science behind red light devices.

Research from @foundmyfitness reveals that children with autism can't detoxify BPA like neurotypical kids can, with bound BPA levels 15 times higher in their systems. The chemical acts as a xenoestrogen, hijacking normal hormone signaling during critical brain development windows. ADHD, anxiety, and depression rates also climb with prenatal exposure. The fix? Ditch plastic water bottles and never heat plastic—heating increases BPA leaching by up to 55x. Multiple studies confirm this isn't just correlation.

Low T often signals deeper health issues lurking beneath the surface: sleep disorders, chronic stress, nutrient gaps, metabolic dysfunction (type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD), endocrine problems (pituitary adenoma, hyperprolactinemia), autoimmune conditions, or genetic developmental disorders.

Early detection changes everything—many cases can be reversed naturally with the right approach.

✅ Advanced lab testing with sensitive assay panels for gold-standard diagnostic accuracy
✅ Expert analysis from specialists who understand the nuances, delivering actionable insights

Your brain needs to recognize the dream as familiar territory, not foreign ground. When you physically interact with what you're building toward, you're programming your mind to see it as inevitable rather than impossible.

The difference between average and elite isn't genetics:
✔️ It's willpower.
✔️ It's resilience.
✔️ It's refusing to stop when your mind is screaming to.

Real transformation happens in the moments when everyone around you keeps going while their minds beg them to quit—that's where internal strength is forged.

Women carrying genetic predispositions or dealing with factors like obesity face amplified impact from alcohol consumption.
