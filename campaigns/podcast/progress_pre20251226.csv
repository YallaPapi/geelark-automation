@edmylett sits down with MO GAWDAT, ex-Chief Business Officer of GOOGLE X, for a conversation that cuts through the noise and reveals what insiders actually know about artificial intelligence.

Mo helped build the tech that's reshaping civilization. Now he's a three-time bestselling author and hosts the #1 mental health podcast SLO MO—and he's pulling back the curtain on what most people are getting wrong.

This conversation tackles the real questions:
- What those working closest to AI development are actually worried about
- The immediate threats versus long-term consequences
- AI-generated relationships between humans and machines
- Which jobs and careers are most vulnerable
- Whether machines can learn ethics or experience emotions
- Why this is humanity's new OPPENHEIMER MOMENT
- Practical steps for using AI to benefit humanity instead of harming it

No hype. No conspiracy theories. Just raw truth from someone who's been inside the room where AI decisions are made.

Ed captures insights that will shift how you think about technology's trajectory and your place in what's coming next.

A psychiatrist who sees people at rock bottom, a Christian philosopher defending divine purpose, and an atheist thinker dismantling comfortable truths walked into the same room.

@thediaryofaceopodcast wasn't looking for easy answers when he sat down with Dr K (@healthygamer_gg), Greg Koukl, and Alex O'Connor (@cosmicskeptic).

Dr K brings insight from working directly with those who've lost their sense of direction, translating their pain into wisdom the rest of us desperately need.

Greg argues that meaning isn't something we create in our heads, it's embedded in reality by something greater than ourselves.

Alex challenges both sides, questioning whether meaning exists at all or if we're just telling ourselves stories to feel better.

The conversation cuts through surface-level takes on why young people are struggling with purpose, why traditional structures are crumbling, and what's actually happening beneath the cultural shift.

They tackled the hard stuff: invented versus discovered meaning, whether this generation is uniquely directionless, religion's actual role in human flourishing, and how our terror of death dictates everything.

No one left with all the answers, but the collision of worldviews created something more valuable than certainty.

He points out that meaningful experiences—whether it's pushing yourself in your career, navigating the complexities of relationships, or exploring new places—all come with their share of difficulty. But that's exactly what gives them value. When you focus on building something substantial rather than chasing a feeling, happiness naturally follows. It's not the destination; it's what happens along the way.

@thediaryofaceopodcast sits down with researcher and author @brenebrown, whose groundbreaking work on shame and courage has reached millions through her nearly 30-million-view TED Talk.

After spending over twenty years researching human connection, Brené unpacks the invisible forces that keep people trapped in cycles of hiding and pretending.

The conversation explores the silent weight of shame, the relationship damage caused by emotional walls, pathways to rebuilding broken trust, and why the need to control everything often backfires.

At a time when so many feel disconnected and inadequate, Brené offers clarity on the patterns most people feel but struggle to name.

This episode digs into the question of what drives someone to dedicate their life to helping others face their deepest fears—and what shifts when we choose to do the same.

For anyone who's ever wondered why fear shows up the way it does, this one's worth the watch.
